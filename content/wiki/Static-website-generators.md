Pelican
==============================================================================

Quick attempt, 09/2017 :

* python powered, familiar
* themes are not easy to find
* templating syntax unfamiliar, I still dislike templating DSLs, should go to `reactjs` templates ?

Hugo
==============================================================================

Tried in 2016, not too happy about it :

* hard to have images next to the `.md` files, in the same folder
* can easily get in a state where it silently fails

but :

* single EXE easy to use
